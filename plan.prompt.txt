You are a senior frontend engineer experienced with Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3).

Create a detailed implementation plan for a Chrome extension that acts as a
two-phase sequential timer.

Functional requirements:
1. The extension has two configurable timers: Timer A and Timer B.
2. The user can set the duration for both timers before starting.
3. The user clicks "Start":
   - Timer A starts counting down.
   - Timer B remains idle.
   - The UI updates the remaining time once per second.
4. When Timer A completes:
   - Show a notification with sound.
   - The notification includes an "OK" button.
5. When the user clicks "OK":
   - Timer B starts counting down.
   - The UI updates the remaining time once per second.
6. When Timer B completes:
   - Show a notification with sound.
   - The notification presents two buttons: "Done" and "Restart".
7. If "Done" is selected:
   - Both timers stop.
   - The extension returns to the initial ready state.
   - "Start" is enabled again.
8. If "Restart" is selected:
   - Timer A restarts using the previously configured duration.

Non-functional requirements:
- Timers must continue to work correctly if the popup is closed.
- State must survive popup open/close cycles.
- Use Chrome extension best practices (Manifest V3).

Please include:
- High-level architecture (popup, background/service worker, storage).
- State machine or state transitions.
- How timers and notifications are handled.
- Suggested data model for timer state.
- Key edge cases (rapid clicks, reloads, browser sleep).
- Optional UX improvements.

Do NOT write full code unless necessary; focus on design and reasoning.
